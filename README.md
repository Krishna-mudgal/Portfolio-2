This is my personal portfolio website built using React and Tailwind CSS.
It features a clean, modern UI with smooth animations using Framer Motion.
The site includes several reusable components like Header, About, Projects, Navbar, Contact and TechStack.
Users can toggle between Dark and Light Mode for a better viewing experience.
Responsive design ensures it looks great on all devices.
The project is structured with clean, maintainable code.
It is deployed and live for public access.
